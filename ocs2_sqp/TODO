This is a todo list of ocs2_sqp package: 

1. 
Now, if some other package is depending on ocs2_sqp, the variable ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} already includes ${blasfeo_INCLUDE_DIRS} & 
${hpipm_INCLUDE_DIRS}, so 

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} INTERFACE
  ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

will be enough. 

However, the same operations do not work with ${catkin_LIBRARIES} & ${HPIPM_LIBS}. So we still need to do: 

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${Boost_LIBRARIES} ${HPIPM_LIBS})

This should be solvable. 

2. 
Though the SQP solver is more robust with repect to initial conditions, for complicated problems such as ANYmal, 
one still needs to specify the stancing initial input for convergence. So, the sqp solver should read the task.info
and manually setup an initial input (task.info could depend on the robot type: ballbot, ANYmal, etc. ).

3. 
The final stage cost function approximation does not work well for ballbot. 
Also, there should be a 10 multiplier for ballbot final cost.
