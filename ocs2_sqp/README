README file for ocs2_sqp package 

0. this package requires external library installation hpipm and blasefo. All should reside in /opt 

Update on 2020-11-10 night: 

1. The current code can be compiled with both 
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug and
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release. But it only runs in Debug mode, not in the Release mode. 
I am still looking for the reason. 
In debug mode, one can run "roslaunch ocs2_sqp ballbot.launch"

2. I don't know how to access the user-defined desired final state of ballbot x_g = (x_pos, y_pos, yaw).
I suppose L = 1/2 (x-x_g)' * Q * (x-x_g), so the linearization of L should return Q*(x-x_g), but it seems not to be the case now. 
So I manually add a term in the hpipm setting "qq". It can somehow move to the goal (1,1) manually set by me. 
However, I still add a final state cost x'Qx which plays against it. So it will diverge after a while. 

3. How to use the final stage cost? The Q_final is typically zero. Shall I just ignore it? 
Do the final stage cost also have linearization version?
