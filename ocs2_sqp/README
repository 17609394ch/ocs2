README file for ocs2_sqp package 

0. this package requires external library installation hpipm and blasefo. All should reside in /opt 

1. right now, the package depends on ocs2_ballbot_example package. 
One may run 
"rosrun ocs2_sqp ocs2_sqp_node mpc 1 " --> command 1 
"rosrun ocs2_sqp ocs2_sqp_node_new mpc 1 " --> command 2 

2. command 1&2 basiclly set the same hpipm solver. their only difference is that 2 uses cost approximation and 1 uses hardcoded ones. 
However, they return different results .............

2. Another really werid thing is that the hpipm solver always return "Solver failed! Minimum step length reached" in command 1. 
I have checked this link https://github.com/giaf/hpipm/issues/56 and adjust a few parameters, but still no fixing 
If I set the Q_final matrix to be zero, then hpipm will always return reasonable solutions but if I set Q_final, then "Solver failed! Minimum step length reached"
I think Q_final is important otherwise we will end up with extremely large ending states 
I also print out the residual information of hpipm but still finds nothing
