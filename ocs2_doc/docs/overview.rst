Overview
========

OCS2 is a C++ toolbox tailored for Optimal Control of Switched Systems (OCS2). The toolbox provides an efficient implementation 
of the following algoirithms:

* SLQ: Continuous-time domin DDP 
* iLQR: Discrete-time domain DDP
* SQP: Multiple-shooting algorithm based on HPIPM <a href="https://github.com/giaf/hpipm">HPIPM</a>
* PISOC: Constrained path integral stochatic optimal control   

OCS2 handles general path constraints through Augmented Lagrangian and relaxed barrier methods. To facilitate the 
application of OCS2 in robotic tasks, it provides the user with additional tools to set up the system dynamics (such as 
kinematic or dynamic models) and cost/constraints (such as self-collision avoidance and end-effector tracking) 
from a URDF model. The library also provides an automatic differentiation tool to calculate derivatives of the system 
dynamics, constraints, and cost. The toolboxâ€™s efficient and numerically stable implementations in conjunction with its 
user-friendly interface have paved the way for deploying it in an MPC fashion for numerous robotic applications with 
limited onboard computation power. The library consists of the following main modules:
